# Yoga Pose Detection and Correction

## Abstract
The primary aim of this project is to ensure proper yoga postures using computer vision techniques, reducing the risk of injuries from incorrect poses. By leveraging PoseNet and a KNN classifier, the system offers real-time guidance for various yoga poses, helping users practice yoga safely at home. The model identifies discrepancies between actual and target poses and provides corrective feedback with high accuracy.
